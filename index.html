      <p class="info">At first, I planned to create a very cool website to show my personality. I designed a very cool
        background and planned to use it as the basis for the design. But when I really started editing the content, I
        found that the background did not match my content. Gradually, I found that I should not let the website design
        style dominate my content, but should let the content dominate the website style, so I deleted the code and
        prepared to start from scratch.</p>

      <p class="info">This time, I first wrote out the main content of the website, including personal contributions,
        reflections, etc. Later, based on this content, I found some great websites on the Internet and compared which
        one was more suitable for me. Finally, I chose a design style and began to prepare for creating a website.

        The template website on the blackboard of the comprehensive course and several <a

        are
        all from <a class="webLink" href="https://pixabay.com/">pixabay</a>. At the same time, in order to make the
        website better, I studied Nielsen's Ten Usability Heuristics (Jakob Nielsen, <a href="#Nielsen" class="webLink">1994</a>)
        to improve the interactive function of the website. I initially determined the style of my website and created
        this website in combination with my own content.</p>

        In this section, we are encouraged to write down a design inspiration for a website, and produce one poster for
        our design concept. My inspiration was to design a game to introduce the evolutionary trajectory of common
        animals in life, which is pretty interesting but hard to achieve, because it is very hard to find a dataset
        which can provide the evolutionary trajectory of common animals in life, and that is also why I didn't take my
        project out to participate in the group bidding.

    <div class="container" style="padding-top: 20px">
      <p class="info" style="width: auto">The pictures presented left are the high fidelity of my
        design. Although this inspiration did not continue as a team assignment, I learned a
        lot from this process, and our team's design is also about animals, which laid a solid foundation for my next
        team work (such as the research and use of dataset, etc.)<br><br>
        Finally, we jointly selected one design. This design is an Animal Guessing Game. We complete our original idea
        of the website by researching on two similar websites (<a class="webLink"
                                                                  href="https://www.bbcearth.com/quiz/guess-that-animal">Guess
          the Animal</a> and <a class="webLink" href="https://earth.google.com/">Animal Sound Quiz</a>). The reason why
        we selected this topic is that we want to enhancing users' familiarity with relevant animal habitats and raising
        awareness of the current status of animals in different regions.

      <p class="info"><span class="title" style="margin-top: 40px">Tough process of obtaining data</span><br>
        In the
        beginning, we created one JS file named <span class="italic">dynamic.js</span> to traverse all the data from the
        dataset and get the data by the “if” statement. Some asynchronous processes are used here, which is convenient
        to read the data at the beginning of the website. But for each step, it needs the data of the previous step,
        which means the data cannot be processed at the same time. So here we add the keyword “await” to solve the
        problem of data synchronization caused by asynchronous. <br><br>
        Almost all the data loading functions are the
        same with the structure. Here is an example of one data loading function, the given function,
        <span class="italic">loadSpeciesData(index)</span>, is a recursive asynchronous function designed to load
        species data for specific
        families using <span class="italic">AJAX</span> calls in JS. Each time, the function will retrieve a URL link
        from the previously loaded
        data (here is <span class="italic">familyData</span>, which stores the family data of each class) and then,
        store the current JSON data to
        <span class="italic">speciesData</span>. The if statement here is used for searching the species that are living
        in marine or aquatic, which is used for loading data for ocean habitat. <br><br>
        Even though it can get the data successfully, but sometimes the incorrect image is also stored in <span
          class="italic">speciesData,</span>
        since some of the multiple images are stored in the dataset for each species, but some are not images of that
        species. There are fewer images of ocean species (only two suitable images), so we need to find other resources
        to finish this project. Our original design contained animal sounds, but we later found that we could not find
        any sound resources from this dataset, and it was impossible to replace the dataset, so we had to
        give up the function of sound. Meanwhile, it needs lots of time for each loading (5 minutes or even longer), so
        we changed the search strategy as we cannot let users wait a long time to start the game.

      <p class="info">Finally, we choose to store the ID of the species in advance and use the API of the dataset to get
        the data we need. As for the lack of pictures of marine animals, we plan to directly store the
        connection of the pictures of the corresponding species in <span class="italic">load_data.js</span>. The
        advantage of this strategy is that
        it does not take such a long time and we can get the correct image for each species.
        There is only one loading function, which is the <span class="italic">loadProfileData()</span> presented left.
        Instead of using the
        URL link obtained from the previous loading function as the previous method, now we use the API link of the
        dataset plus the ID of the species, it will return a json file stores the whole information of that species.
        Then we store the data to <span class="italic">speciesProfile</span> for the game.<br><br>
        The picture shown on the right is a code snippet of our final project. Due to the use of the built-in API of the
        dataset, our function to obtain data has changed from the original 5 to one, and the efficiency of the search
        has been greatly improved. At the same time, for species that can't find pictures, we use external library
        resources instead of picture resources in the dataset to solve the problem of insufficient pictures. Thanks to
        the tutor who gave us suggestions, we finally finished our website on time and moved towards the next
        goal.<br><br>

        <span class="strong">JQuery: </span>The jQuery library is used in the code, which is a fast and concise
        JavaScript framework for simplifying HTML document traversal, event processing, animation design and Ajax
        interaction. For example, <span class="italic">$(document).ready(function() {...}) </span>and <span
          class="italic">$.ajax({...})</span> in both <span class="italic">dynamic.js</span> and <span
          class="italic">load_data.js </span>are all functions provided by jQuery.<br><br>

        <span class="strong">Modularization:</span> The code is organized into distinct functional blocks or modules,
        such as loading data, refreshing data, and handling button click events. Each module has a specific
        responsibility, ensuring a clear and structured codebase.<br><br>

        <span class="strong">Asynchronous Programming:</span> Asynchronous features, like <span
          class="italic">async</span> function and <span class="italic">await </span>in <span
          class="italic">loadData()</span> function, are employed primarily for loading species information.
        Asynchronous programming allows for operations to be executed without waiting for the previous operation to
        complete, which is especially valuable when loading substantial amounts of data.<br><br>

        <span class="strong">DOM Manipulation: </span>The code frequently carries out operations on DOM elements, such
        as setting button text or updating image links.<br><br>

        <span class="strong">Call-backs and Promises:</span>
        Within the <span class="italic">loadProfileData()</span> function, the jQuery <span class="italic">$.ajax</span>
        method
        is combined with Promises to manage asynchronous operations. Utilizing Promises offers a more intuitive approach
        to handling the success and failure scenarios of asynchronous operations.

      <p class="info" style="margin-top: 50px"><span class="title">What have I learned?</span><br>
        After nearly ten weeks of hard work, we have gradually finished the guessing game project. Now we can get the
        data from the dataset and put it on the interface. For me, I learned how to create an API and use it to retrieve
        the data from the dataset and how to deploy a website from local to the internet, how to create a <span
          class="italic">README</span> file
        and add it in project (refers <a
          href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes"
          class="webLink">GitHub Docs</a>). I also learned how to generate
        a website dynamically, which is pretty cool. <br><br>

        This is also the first time I have used GitHub to submit and save my own code. Learning how to use GitHub is
        difficult but interesting. From the beginning, I didn't know anything, but later I can use LFS to
        submit files accurately. This is not only a training of programming skills, but also an exercise of teamwork,
        which is
        very important, because in my future work, I need to use Git frequently for teamwork. What I have learned now
        is crucial to my future work. The following picture expresses my history progress of creating the web.</p>
      <img src="img/Fou_Page/Submission_History.png" class="subHistory" alt="Submission history">
      <p class="info" style="margin-top: 30px">
        Although we achieved the initial goal, there are still some things that we need to focus on, such as how to
        improve the efficiency of loading data from the dataset, how to minimize the HTML files (because the structure
        of the game page is quite same, we can use JavaScript to create the HTML file automatically). As you can see,
        there are
        still many things that can be improved on this website.
      </p>
      <p class="info" style="margin-top: 50px"><span class="title">Contribution</span><br>
        For 2A and 2B, the contributions are talked above.
        For 2C, I made the research and started creating the API of the web. In this process, I created <span
          class="italic">dynamic.js</span>. For 2D, I finished the part of the Web API. In this process, I finished the
        data loading function of ocean page and created <span class="italic">load_data.js</span>. For 2E, I finished the back-end of the project, and finished the working system part of the report.
      </p>

      <p class="info" style="margin-top: 50px"><span class="title">Future Directions</span><br>
        As I said before, there are still many things that can be improved in this project, one of which I most want to
        do is to improve dynamic.js so that I can use this file to load data, because I hope to judge directly in this
        file instead of finding out which species are suitable for our project in advance. This requires me to optimize
        the search process and improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Although it is difficult, I believe it can still
        be done.<br><br>

        For this portfolio website, in addition to beautifying the interface, I also want to add a button function to
        the far right of the navigation bar. I designed it but I don't have time to finish it. This button is used to
        jump to my previous project because this website is published on the Internet, and I hope to make this website
        my own blog website for later job hunting.
      </p>
      <p class="info" style="margin-top: 50px"><span class="title">Conclusion</span><br>
        Through this project, I learned how to design and deploy a website from beginning to end. In the process, I
        improved my code ability and learned how to use Github for teamwork. Now, it's time to say goodbye to this
        project, but the story keeps going. I hope to continue to create interesting websites with friends on the road
        to future learning.
